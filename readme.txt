Voting app - my first simple project in Django.


A voting application created in Python using the Django framework. In the main application window there is a list of selected "questions". After clicking one of them, all possible answers are displayed. After voting, the current survey results are displayed. Additional voting questions can be added only by admin after logging into his profile.

Security is added in the application, e.g. Questions without selections will not be displayed, Questions from the future will not be displayed.

Technology used: Python, Django, CSS, Tests
