Voting app - my first simple project in Django.


A simple voting application created in Python using the Django framework. Voting can be made by anyone who has the link to this application. The main application window presents a list of selected 'Questions'. After clicking on a specific one, all possible answers are displayed. After voting, the current survey results are shown.


Security is added in the application, e.g. Questions without selections will not be displayed, Questions from the future will not be displayed.
