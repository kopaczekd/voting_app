Voting app - my first simple project in Django.


A simple voting application created in Python using the Django framework. Voting can be made by anyone who has the link to this application. The main application window presents a list of selected 'Questions'. After clicking on a specific one, all possible answers are displayed. After voting, the current survey results are shown.
